# Convergence test

The fulltest.sh will run an automated full convergence test for all MHD wave types
and plot the results.
A compiled version of ppkMHD and a running Python environment with matplat are
a prerequisite.

Edit the header of fulltest to adapt to your local environment.

Afterwards just run fulltest.sh
