/** @brief Initialize, finalize, and query the MPI environment.
 *
 *  The @c environment class is used to initialize, finalize, and
 *  query the MPI environment. It will typically be used in the @c
 *  main() function of a program, which will create a single instance
 *  of @c environment initialized with the arguments passed to the
 *  program:
 *
 *  @code
 *  int main(int argc, char* argv[])
 *  {
 *    mpi::environment env(argc, argv);
 *  }
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  The instance of @c environment will initialize MPI (by calling @c
 *  MPI_Init) in its constructor and finalize MPI (by calling @c
 *  MPI_Finalize for normal termination or @c MPI_Abort for an
 *  uncaught exception) in its destructor.
 *
 *  The use of @c environment is not mandatory. Users may choose to
 *  invoke @c MPI_Init and @c MPI_Finalize manually. In this case, no
 *  @c environment object is needed. If one is created, however, it
 *  will do nothing on either construction or destruction.
